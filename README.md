melody-plus-chords
==================

This is an experimental version of purescript-abc-melody which adds the ability to play chords if they are present in the ABC representation.  These are 'played' using a rhythm guitar soundfont on channel 1 whilst the main melody remains 'played' on the piano on channel 0.
